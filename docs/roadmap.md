# Stratos Roadmap - Out of date

Last Updated: 2 July 2018

# Version 2 Timeline

The current focus is on releasing V2 of Stratos. The current timeline is:

|Date|Milestone|
|---|---|
|15 June|Beta 1|
|20 June|Beta 2|
|25 June|RC 1|
|29 June|RC 2|

Post 2.0 is released we will be working towards a regular recycle cycle each Sprint - we may start with Monthly releases and finally to releases each 2 weeks.

## Agile

We work on a 2-week Sprint cycle. Sprints start on Wednesdays. For reference, Sprint 27 started 4 April 2018.

We are using GitHub issues to track all work items. See: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stratos/issues
